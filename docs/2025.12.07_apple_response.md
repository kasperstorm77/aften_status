Re: Guideline 4.8 - Login Services

My app does not use Google Sign-In as a login service or for account creation. The app functions fully offline with all data stored locally on the device.

Google Sign-In is used solely as an OAuth authorization mechanism to optionally enable backup functionality to the user's own Google Drive. Specifically:

1. No account is created - Users can use the app completely without ever signing into Google
2. The feature is optional - Google Drive backup is an opt-in feature for users who want cloud backup of their data
3. Limited scope - I use the drive.appdata scope which only allows access to a hidden app-specific folder in the user's Drive, not their personal files
4. No data collection - I do not collect, store, or have access to the user's email, name, or any personal information from their Google account
5. User's own storage - Data is backed up to the user's own Google Drive, not to any server

This is functionally equivalent to how apps like document editors allow "Save to Google Drive" without requiring Sign in with Apple as an alternative.

I chose Google Drive for backup specifically because:
- It provides cross-platform portability (users can access their data from any device)
- Users maintain full ownership and control of their data
- No server infrastructure is needed, enhancing privacy

Re: Guideline 5.1.1(v) - Account Deletion

Since no account is created in my app or on any server, there is no account to delete. Users can:

1. Disconnect Google Drive access at any time via the app's Settings by tapping "Sign out"
2. Revoke app permissions from their Google Account settings at https://myaccount.google.com/permissions
3. Delete their backed-up data from Google Drive directly, or through the app's backup management features
4. Delete all local data using the "Delete All Entries" option in Settings

The Google OAuth connection is purely for API access authorization, not account creation.

Additionally, I have implemented an explicit "Disconnect Google Drive & Delete Backup" feature in the Settings page that allows users to:
1. Sign out from Google
2. Delete ALL backup data stored in their Google Drive's app-specific folder

This gives users complete control over their data and provides a clear mechanism to remove all cloud-stored data at any time.

Summary

Aften Status is a personal journaling app that stores all data locally on the user's device. The optional Google Drive integration is purely for backup purposes using the user's own storage - no accounts are created, no personal data is collected, and users have full control to disconnect and delete their backup data at any time.

I respectfully request reconsideration of this submission.

Thank you for your time.
